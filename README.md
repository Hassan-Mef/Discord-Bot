# Discord Bot (Learn / Dev Project)

This is a **Discord bot** built for learning and experimenting with Discord.js v14.  
Itâ€™s not meant to be production-ready but serves as a structured project to understand how to build bots with slash commands, events, and modular code organization.

## ðŸš€ Running the Bot

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with:
   ```
   TOKEN=your-bot-token
   CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   GUILD_ID=your-guild-id
   ```

3. Register the slash commands:
   ```bash
   node src/register-commands.js
   ```

4. Start the bot:
   ```bash
   node src/index.js
   ```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This project is for **learning purposes** (not production-ready).  
- Code is modularized for clarity: commands are self-contained, events are separated.  
- New features can easily be added by creating a new file in `src/commands/`.
